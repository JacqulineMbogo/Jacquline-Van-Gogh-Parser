# Jacquline Scraper Solution

This project is a simple web scraper built using **Kotlin**, **Spring Boot**, and **Selenium** to fetch a list of results from a specified web page. The project exposes an API that returns a list of result details in JSON format.

I chose **Kotlin** with **Spring Boot** for this project because It is my language of choice, and I am most comfortable working with it.

I have used **Selenium** because it is a powerful tool for web scraping, especially when dealing with websites that use **JavaScript** to render content dynamically. Many websites today rely on JavaScript to load data, and traditional scraping methods (like `Jsoup`) wonâ€™t work in these cases. Selenium, being a browser automation tool, can interact with JavaScript content and allow us to extract data that would otherwise be hidden.

I used `findElementByCssSelector` in Selenium because **CSS selectors** provide a simple and flexible way to navigate and extract elements from a web page. They are easy to write and understand, and they can be very powerful when selecting elements that have specific classes, IDs, or attributes.
